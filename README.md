# Credit Risk Pricing Model

## 🚀 Project Goal
To deepen my understanding of credit risk, this project will analyze Taiwanese consumer loan data to predict defaults using a variety of data‑mining techniques. I’ll compare model accuracy in estimating Probability of Default and explore the relationship between interest rates and default likelihood.

## Data Overview

The study took payment data in October, 2005, from an
important bank (a cash and credit card issuer) in Taiwan
and the targets were credit card holders of the bank.
Among the total 30,000 observations, 6636 observations
(22.12%) are the cardholders with default payment. This
research employed a binary variable – default payment
(Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. 

The data is obtained from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO-XdleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHVTywu6Qx2uUPBRIr4Ok_TK7dswnh-qnUJn0xb0ArjPZ7-UTknqTCHVcJg_aem_4Yv9f48SV0XG_RLQOy5qxQ)
